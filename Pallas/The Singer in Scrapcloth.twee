hooray, this is the good storylet! 

The main quest will mainly involve your direct relationship with a few main characters over the course of the city's history, from rulers to peasants, prophets to fools. 

Your choices in guiding the city will also fill a "deck" of events which will appear between main-plot story beats and show the evolving state of your city over time. these can be boons like bountiful harvests or creative golden ages or banes like plagues or invasions. 

Choices that can be rotated through look like (cycling-link: "this","or this","or also this","this as well","definitely not this","just kidding, they look like this").

Choices which advance the story and "lock in" all of your choices $vitalText[(link-goto: "like this","Good storylet 2")].






Good! well done, you. Now let's go over some basic mechanics. Your city is going to have four main attributes: 

[$textAppear+$beatDelay[Prosperity (currently $cityProsperity), representing material wealth. High Prosperity will lead to positive events, low Prosperity to negative events.]]

[$textAppear+$delayTwo[Strength, (currently $cityStrength) representing the strength of its armies. High Strength will allow Your city to defend itself, while a low strength might see it conquered by its neighbors.]]

[$textAppear+$delayThree[Piety, (currently $cityPiety) representing the degree to which Your people believe in You. High Piety will mean Your followers obey your every command, while low Piety followers may abandon you for other gods.]]

[$textAppear+$delayFour[Stability (currently $cityStability) representing how popular stable the city's government currently is. High Stability cities will tend towards order and continuity, while low Stability cities may face revolts, crises, or even revolution.]]

Let's $vitalText(link-goto:"try this out with an example", "Good storylet 3")
